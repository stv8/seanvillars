Like **, all good things come to an end or at least a pause.

I am bummed to announce that I will be pausing [Skateboardle](https://skateboardle.com) games **starting with game 180** (frontside or backside pun intended).

The main reason is boring, but it is simply due to the lack of time I have availalble to continue adding a game every day.

Adding a single game typically takes me anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes, which is increasingly difficult to come by as a new dad and working full time. I'm trying to simplify my day a bit and `Skateboardle` is just one extra thing I have on my task plate every day.

I have tried to figure out alternatives, such as automating the games, or making it easier for others to contribute games. However each has a downside.

#### Automation issues

I implemented a proof of concept in which the entire thing could be done by a scheduled program. A video was selected, downloaded, split up by clips (thanks `ffmpeg`), and then 6 clips chose at random all done automatically. However it didn't take long to realize the quality of the game would suffer tremendously. After only a few test runs of truly random "clip selection", I could see that the game would not be as fun as if the clips were hand picked.

Throughout the game I made sure to put a lot of thought into which clips were selected. For example, the first clip is usually difficult and the last clip should make the video obvious. Or there were funny clips, for example, in the `Blind - What If?` game I included James Craig's clip where the song literally says *`And you're watching What If`*. Or I would just pick clips that were standouts from the video.

#### Issues with Accepting more contributions

The downside for allowing others to help more is simply that I still have to manage the quality control and upload the games, which takes a non-zero amount of time. I know it might sound lame but it's still an extra thing I have to keep tabs on and I'm not sure it really alleviates my time enough.

I've actually had help over the course of `Skateboardle` by `SkateVideoSite`'s own resident skate nerd `Frankiesomethin`. He has helped with roughly ~40 of the games and I can't thank him enough.


#### Skateboardle Retrospective
I plan on doing an additional `Skateboardle: A Retrospective` post where I will go over some fun statistics such as win percentages, total games played, etc. I also want to go over the actual code itself as I plan on open sourcing the codebase, and share some of the additional things I've learned from the experience.

This has been one of the projects I have been most proud. It went from idea to execution in under a month, and in that time was able to become part of the Skate-internet subculture.

### Closing Thoughts

I have been anxious to write this up as I know I have built quite a dedicated audience around the game and am sorry to let you down. I am so very stoked to have seen the growth and to see people playing it every day. My goal was always to just make something people enjoyed and that could spark a little bit of joy in their day. I thank everyone for playing.

The time has come to get some time back. Also this will allow me some back to continue improving [SkateVideoSite](https://skatevideosite.com).

Thanks everyone, Cheers.
